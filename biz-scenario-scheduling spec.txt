I manage the appointment scheduling at our healthcare facility. We've been scheduling and keeping track of our appointments on pen and paper until now, but after we've had some bad mess-up recently, we've decided that it's time to get a good system in place to help record the data. Here is what we will need to keep track of: Patients' full name, DOB, phone number, the date and time of the appointment, the provider's name, the reason for the visit and a blank space for the Provider to write a brief summary of the visit. (We want to keep it short - not more than 200 characters)

Note that since Covid, our providers are also seeing some patients via telehealth. For those appointments, we would like a unique code to be generated - that will then be shared with the patient as a password to access their visit. Make sure it is different for every appointment and that it's complicated enough so that nobody else can figure it out and join uninvited.

We would also like to have a unique reference number for each appointment as 1st 2 digits of last name, then 1st 2 digits of first name, then the appt. day of month (Ex. John Smith appt. 07/08/2023 - SMJO08) Please make sure they're all uppercase.


Questions:
1- Do you need to record the patients' insurance information?--No, that is handled on a different platform.
2- Can your providers also 'see' a patient over the phone?--No, we cannot bill insurance if we don't see the patient face to face.
3- Do you ever have walk-ins?--No, appointments must be scheduled at least 1 day in advance.
4- Can you have more than one patient scheduled for the same time?--Yes, as long as they are seen by different providers


I will need the following reports:
-The total amount of Telehealth appts. comparing the last three years. 
-The number of days prior to the appts. that the appts. are scheduled, comparing the Telehealth appts. to the in-person appts.
-The Provider with the most appts.-The Provider with the lowest number of appts.-The average number of appts. per Provider.
-The amount of appts. per department (General, Dentistry, Ophthalmology, Dermatology)
-A report of all the past visits in this format: Date and Time of appointment: Patients Last Name, Patients First Name - Appointment Summary
